This project is simply a better browser for use with I2P.

We have taken the Tor Browser, did some modifications, and arranged it to fit the PortableApps format.

This project is a part of the I2P Portable Apps project. The I2P Portable Apps project is a project aimed at making I2P use portable. The project may get renamed at some point.

Current Projects with the I2P Portable Apps project:
* I2PPortable - https://github.com/ThePrudentNinja/I2PPortable
* I2PBrowserWin - https://github.com/ThePrudentNinja/I2PBrowserWin
* I2PBrowserLin - https://github.com/ThePrudentNinja/I2PBrowserLin
* I2PPortableLin - https://github.com/ThePrudentNinja/I2PPortableLin

Modifications from original Tor browser:
* Added FoxyProxy
* Added a configuration for FoxyProxy to use I2P
* Removed the tor-launcher and https-everywhere addons
* Modified the tor-button addon to keep the annoying tab from popping up saying "Something went wrong"
* Set the security slider to max in the tor-button addon
* Rearranged everything to fit the PortableApps standards

Please note, it's possible I overlooked something. I did this in a couple of hours of tinkering.
